# Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

My name is Alex, and I’m currently a student at the Hochschule Furtwangen University in Germany. I’ve been passionate about programming and artificial intelligence for many years, starting long before I entered college. This GitHub profile serves as a space to document and showcase the personal projects I’ve worked on over the years.

## 🛠️ About Me
- 🌱 **Learning Journey**: My knowledge in programming and AI stems from self-driven learning, passion projects, and ongoing academic pursuits.
- 👩‍💻 **Purpose of This Profile**:  
  - To organize and display my past projects.  
  - To share what I’ve learned, including successes and challenges.  
- 🌍 **Looking Forward**: I’m eager to collaborate, learn from others, and contribute to innovative projects in software engineering and machine learning.

## 🚀 Projects Overview
Here are a few of the projects I’ve worked on. Feel free to explore the repositories for more details:

### 1️⃣ **Stock Analysis and Backtesting Tool**  
- **Description**: Built a Python program to backtest stock trading strategies written in `.py` scripts and compare their performance to the S&P 500. While I couldn’t implement automated trading, the tool is fully functional for backtesting and analyzing strategies.  
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Financial APIs, Tensorflow 
- **Repository**: https://github.com/alexander5525/stock

### 2️⃣ **Text-to-Audio Neural Network**  
- **Description**: A neural network designed from scratch to generate audio files from text documents. While the project didn’t fully achieve its goals, the AI model worked as intended and taught me valuable lessons about neural network architectures and debugging.  
- **Technologies Used**: C++ 
- **Repository**: https://github.com/alexander5525/cppTTSai

## 🧠 What I Bring
- Strong foundations in programming languages like **Python** and **Java**, and a passion for designing and debugging complex systems.
- Experience with machine learning frameworks like **TensorFlow** and working with data analysis libraries such as **NumPy** and **Pandas**.
- A mindset of continuous improvement—every project is an opportunity to grow and learn.

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
